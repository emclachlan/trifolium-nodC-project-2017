> remove repeat strains from 2016 data set
> rename 2015 data set?
> make document with every single nodC strain, sequence, etc.


2018-01-12
> made directory /data/2018-01-12
> in directory, renamed all of the 2016 strains to uniform naming conventions
> Script for rename can be found in src and in data folder: agrename5.sh
> data/2018-01-12 now contains: raw .ab1 files and renamed .ab1 files
> moved renamed strains to hpcc (MSU) to run through phred	
	$scp -r "foldername" yourname@hpcc.msu.edu:/mnt/home/yourname/
	$module load phred
	$PHRED_PARAMETER_FILE=phredpar.dat
	$phred -id file -trim_alt "" -trim_cutoff 0.01 -s -q -st fasta -trim_out
	$cat *.seq > nameoffile.fa
	$scp yourname@hpcc.msu.edu:/mnt/home/yourname/file.fa ./
> made directory /results/2018-01-12
  -contains ag-seqfile.fa: the concatonated sequence file of the renamed 2016 strains
  -made a copy of ag-seqfile.fa: ag-seqfile-copy.fa
  -made document called "poorqualitystrains" where I put all of the strains I removed from ag-seqfile-copy.fa
  -uploaded ag-seqfile-copy.fa (with poor quality strains removed) to hpcc
	$scp ag-seqfile-copy.fa mclach10@hpcc.msu.edu:mnt/home/mclach10/TrifoliumDimensions/SandernodC/2018-01-12/phredfiles
> in hpcc, ran clustalo
	$module load clustalO/1.1.0
	$clustalo -i ag-seqfile-copy.fa -o ag-clustalo.fa -v
> moved ag-clustalo.fa back to home computer, results folder
> made ag-clustalo-copy.fa
> ran ag-clustalo-copy.fa through UGENE to trim the alignment files. exported file ag-align.fa
> copied ag-align.fa --> ag-align-copy.fa, ran through Cd-Hit (identity 1.0)
> moved tar file to /data/2018-01-12/ag-cdhit.result.tar
> moved opened tar folder to results/2018-01-12/ag-cdhit.result


2018-01-11
> continued collecting metadata
> matching names to PCR positions to well.id's
> made directory /data/2018-01-11 to house just the nodC files 
from 2016, for the purposes of renaming them.

> Collecting 2016 metadata to rename strains 

2017-12-18
> added tar files and opened tar folders to data
	data/2017-12-18/tarfiles/
	data/2017-12-18/opened-tar-folders
> uploaded tar files to google drive
	nodC paper/data/rawdata/2018

> writing code to easily grab headers and change the names
> can be found in src (findingstuff.sh)
	to run: $ python findingstuff.sh
	*it's a python script, but when I wrote it I ended in bash. doesn't seem to make a difference though.

2017-10-31
> renamed strains 1-72
> aligned strains 1-72 (AG_1-72_align.fa)
> trimmed alignment (AG_1-72_aligntrim.fa)
> CDHit on AG_1-72_aligntrim.fa (AG_1-72_CDhit.tar)


2017-10-17
> created folder
> added readme & data folders
> copied 'seq_nodC_145-240.fa' to data folder
	 'seq_nodC_1-144.dmg'  to data folder
	- files contain fasta files from BTC2016 strains
> ran clustalo (HPCC) on seq_nodC_145-240 using code in bodega-strain-collection-2017/src/protocol-ClustalOHPCC
> added resulting file 'BTC16_145-240_alignment.fa' to data/2017-10-17
> trimmed the alignment using UGENE
> copied the trimmed alignment to data/2017-10-17
  "BTC16_145-240_alignedtrim.fa
> ran the trimmed alignment through CD-HIT-EST to get clusters
> copied cluster results folder to data/2017-10-17
  "BTC16-145-240_CD-HIT
