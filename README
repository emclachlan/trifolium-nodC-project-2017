The goal of this project is to write a manuscript using the nodC 
sanger sequences from each bodega collection:
2015: dried nodules
2015: strains
2016: strain collection
2016: frozen nodules
2017: strain collection

By looking at nodC variation across years and species, we can detect
links between SNPs which tell a story about the evolution of these
closely related species.
